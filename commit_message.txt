feat(select): hover highlight and viewport alignment for element selection

- Fix tunnelUrls type: index with string "8080" in session page (Record<string, string>)
- Remove Chrome extension package and references (eslint, docs, READMEs)
- Fix Select overlay: capture clicks on overlay instead of iframe (remove pointer-events-none, add onClick to overlay)
- Sandbox: get_element_at_point.py accepts optional viewport width/height, returns element boundingRect for highlight
- Bridge: pass viewportWidth/viewportHeight to script when provided
- Control plane + router: accept viewport in element-at-point body, forward to sandbox
- Web: send viewport with element-at-point requests; throttled hover (120ms) fetches element and boundingRect; draw blue highlight from rect; lighter overlay (bg-black/10); clear highlight on mouse leave and when leaving select mode

Redeploy Modal, control plane, and web for full hover-highlight and viewport-aligned selection.
